# Algorithms test projects

Currently I am reading the book Algorithms "An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people". This project aims to test each of the algorithms studied and validate the eficiency against their regular counterparts.

The algorithms currently tested are:
- Chapter 1: Binary Search

The running time of a regular search where each element needs to be checked is of O(n) and for binary search is of O(log n), that means that when the amount of element in the array increases binary seach will be a lot more efficient if compare to a regular search.

- Chapter 2: Selection Sort

Execution time of this algorithm is of O(n^2). Which means that in the same way the array length increases, the execution time of the algorithm grows exponentially.
